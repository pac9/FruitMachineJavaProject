# FruitMachineJavaProject

Project brief issued by CodeClan

Goal: Create a fruit machine in Java.

You have been asked to create a simple piece of software that will operate a fruit machine.

Your FruitMachine class should be well tested, and should have a spin() method that returns an integer value - the amount of winnings from the Symbol's value, if three identical symbols are spun.
If three identical symbols aren't spun, you should return 0.

MVP

The aim is to display the results of the Java logic. For example, if the user spins and lands 3 matching symbols a winning message is displayed and their winnings updated and stored.
